            <h2>Why Wellington?</h2>

            <p>
              Wellington’s reputation as New Zealand’s culinary capital is
              well-deserved: it has more eateries and bars per capita than New
              York City. Wellington is famous for its tucked-away bars, café
              culture, award-winning restaurants and bars, and great coffee.
              Head to Courtenay Place or Cuba Street to get amongst the good
              stuff.

            <h4>Classic New Zealand Wine Trail</h4>
            <p>
              Located in the heart of the Classic New Zealand Wine Trail - a
              journey through regions that cover more than 80% of New Zealand’s
              wine production - Wellington is a great place to start your
              wine-tasting journey. Marlborough, Wairarapa and Hawkes' Bay are
              all a few hours' drive or ferry-ride away from Wellington and
              offer unforgettable food and wine experiences.
            </p>
            <h4>A gateway to the South Island</h4>
            <p>
              If you want to visit the South Island, Wellington is the city is
              the place to board the inter-island ferry with or without a car.
              This three-and-a-half-hour ferry ride is one of the most
              spectacular ferry crossings in the world. Bluebridge(opens in new
              window) and the Interislander(opens in new window) both run
              regular daily services between the North and South Islands. For
              those looking for a little extra, Bluebridge offers an overnight
              sleeper service, and Interislander has a Premium Lounge available
              onboard. The crossing takes passengers through the Cook Strait,
              past the magnificent scenery of the Marlborough Sounds, before
              berthing in the picturesque town of Picton at the top of the South
              Island - the journey also runs from Picton to Wellington.
